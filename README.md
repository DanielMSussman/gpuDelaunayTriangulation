# gpuDelaunayTriangulation




Lorem ipsum... a repository that provides an implementation of the parallelized, localized Delaunay triangulation routine described in Chen, Renjie, and Craig Gotsman. "Localizing the delaunay triangulation and its parallel implementation." Transactions on Computational Science XX. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2013. 39-55, focusing on an entirely GPU-centric implementation (see cellGPU by Daniel M. Sussman for a CPU-centric use of the same idea).
